In your coding journey, you must have come across the Fibonacci series which is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of its two preceding numbers.

A Fibonacci number sequence is defined mathematically by its recurrence relationship

F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>  
Where F<sub>0</sub>=0 and F<sub>1</sub>=1

As the name suggests, in this project we will be creating a recursive/iteration function that takes input and create Fibonacci numbers according to the formula.

The function will take in three integer values, in which the first two values serve as F<sub>0</sub> Â and F<sub>1</sub> . The third integer is the nth number that the iteration should go to. It should return the nth value of Fibonacci sequence with the two starting values.

**Things to remember:**

Ensure your data type is large enough to accommodate Fibonacci values  

You can hardcode the testing values, make sure the first two values are not both 0s

Fibonacci(0, 1, 10) should return 55,

Fibonacci(2, 1, 9) should return 76
