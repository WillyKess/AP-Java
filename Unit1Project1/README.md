**General Statement :** This program reads in 5 numbers at a time from console.  The 5 numbers represent the result of rolling the 5 dice as part of the YAHTZEE game.  The program will look at the 5 dice values and output how the 5 dice values should be used.  In YAHTZEE, a FULL HOUSE is worth 25 points and a 3 OF A KIND has a point value equal to the sum of all 5 dice.  Sometimes it is better to count a roll as a 3 OF A KIND instead of a FULL HOUSE. You may assume that you roll can be counted as a FULL HOUSE or a 3 OF A KIND.  Your program must SUM all five dice and determine whether a FULL HOUSE (worth 25 points) or a 3 OF A KIND (sum of all dice) would get the player the most points.

**Input:** The first line in the data set is an integer that represents the number of data sets that follow.   Each data set will consist of 5 dice values.

**Data Input:** Use console input or hard code the entries.

**Output:** FULL HOUSE  if the dice values should be used as a   FULL HOUSE  (25 points) or output   3 OF A KIND  if the dice values should be used as a     3 OF A KIND  (sum of all dice).

**Assumptions / Helpful Hints :** You will always have 5 dice values that range in value from 1 to 6.   You will always have  3 of a kind and 2 of a kind .  If 3 OF A KIND and FULL HOUSE have the same point value output FULL HOUSE.

**Sample Input:**

3  
5 5 2 2 2  
6 6 6 5 5  
6 6 5 5 5

**Sample Output:**

FULL HOUSE  
3 OF A KIND  
3 OF A KIND
